Selenium IDE- Locating Strategies
For most of the Selenium commands, we need a target location which uniquely defines the web element in the context of a web application.

A target consists of a locating strategy and has a format like:

LocatorType = LocatorStrategy  
In Selenium IDE, a target works on six modes of specifying location of a particular web element which are:


Locating by Identifier
Locating by ID Element
Locating by Name
Locating by XPath
Locating by CSS
Locating by DOM
