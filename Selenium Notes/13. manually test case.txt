Selenium IDE- Creating Test Cases Manually
In this section, you will learn how to create a test case manually using Selenium commands in Selenium IDE. In simple words, we will create test cases by inserting selenium commands instead of recording option.

For this test, we will search a text operation on any publically available search engine (say "Google"). Subsequently, we will create a Login test case in the same test suite.

To create a test case manually, first you have to go through the most commonly used selenium commands which we have discussed in the previous section. Now, we will create our first test case on search operation. We will search our text on Google search engine.


1. Insert Commands
Launch Firefox browser.
Click on the Selenium icon present on the top right corner on your browser.
It will launch the default interface of Selenium IDE.
Enter the project name as "Manual Test".
Enter the test case name as "Search Test".
Click on the command text box present on the Test Script Editor Box.

Modify the properties of First command as:
Command : open
Target : https://www.google.co.in
During execution of the test case, this command will load the Google search engine web page on your Firefox browser.

Now, we have to add a command that will click on the Google search engine text box. For this, we need a unique identification element of the text box which will help the IDE to identifythe target location.

The method for finding a unique identification element involves inspection of HTML codes.

Open URL: https://www.google.co.inyour Firefox browser.
Right click on the Google search text box and select Inspect Element.

Note: The "Value" portion of the Test Script Editor box is optional for most of the commands.
We will use the same identification ID for our third command. The third command will type the specified text in to the Google search text box.

Modify the properties of third command as:
Command : type
Target : id=lst-ib
Value: javaTpointJavaFX tutorial
During execution of the test case, this command will type the specified text on the Google search text box.

We will now add a command which will generate a button click event on our web page. For this event to be generated, we need a unique identification element for the Google search button.

Right click on the Google search button and select Inspect Element.

Now, we will create our second test case within the same test suite.

We will generate a test case based on login feature provided by one of the most popular website "Rediffmail".

First you have sign-up to get the login credentials. For this test, we have already generated our login credentials.

1. Insert Commands
Click on the "Add new test" button at the top of the test case pane.
